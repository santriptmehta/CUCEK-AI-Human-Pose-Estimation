      Recent advancements in Deep Learning has added a huge boost to the already rapidly
      developing field of computer vision. With deep learning, a lot of new applications of computer
      vision techniques have been introduced and are now becoming parts of our everyday lives.

      Pose Estimation is a subset of computer vision that refers to computer vision techniques that detect
      human figures in images and video, so that one could determine, for example, where someoneâ€™s
      ankle shows up in an image. Applying computer vision techniques, is a promising way to detect movement and posture
      errors in yoga and other fitness exercises.
